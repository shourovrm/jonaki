# Decisions

Numbered log; newest at the bottom; it grows as needed. Keep each entry to a
few short lines. Only the user changes a status. The full reasoning for
D-001 to D-020 is in `docs/planning-chat-2026-10-02.md`.

Format:
```
## D-NNN · YYYY-MM-DD · Title — status
Decision. Why: reason. Rejected: alternative (reason). Outcome: pending.
```

## D-001 · 2026-10-02 · Governance — accepted
AGENTS.md (rules), CLAUDE.md (pointer), STATUS.md (≤20 lines), this log,
plans in docs/plans/ with a "Resume from" line. Agent proposes, user rules.
Agent commits after each incremental change (≤80-character subject, AI
trailer allowed). Rejected: OPFlow's journal, ledgers, script maps (research
records an app does not need).

## D-002 · 2026-10-02 · Name Jonaki (জোনাকি, firefly) — accepted
Rejected: Tuntuni, Wren, Setu, Kheya.

## D-003 · 2026-10-02 · General phone agent first, light coding — accepted
Why: user will not build apps on the phone. Rejected: coding agent first.

## D-004 · 2026-10-02 · No Linux sandbox — accepted
Built-in tools in app folders; SSH to PC or VPS later. Rejected: proot
(150 MB, hangs until reboot in Kai 9000 #359), Termux (second app).

## D-005 · 2026-10-02 · Runtime rules from Kai 9000 — accepted
API search with fallbacks; capped tool output; heavy research in subagents;
always stream, live steps, Stop button; tool time limits, step budgets;
loop in a foreground service, every step saved; stable system prompt;
summaries only between messages, originals kept.

## D-006 · 2026-10-02 · Stack — accepted
Kotlin, Compose, coroutines, Room, OkHttp with SSE, kotlinx.serialization,
Keystore for keys, WorkManager. Android only, minSdk 26. Rejected: React
Native, Flutter (heavier); Kotlin Multiplatform (unneeded platforms).

## D-007 · 2026-10-02 · One module per tool (Unix rule) — accepted
Each tool, provider, search backend, runtime, decider and screen is a Gradle
module depending only on core/. Text in, text out; spill large output to a
file. Rejected: one tools module with packages (not cleanly removable).

## D-008 · 2026-10-02 · Threads with own memory; global memory, skills — accepted
Thread owns messages, memory, folder (inbox/, work/, artifacts/), overrides.
User can add, edit, delete, pin, promote memories.

## D-009 · 2026-10-02 · Memory storage — accepted
SQLite facts table with full-text index (FTS5 trigram if spike S-1 passes,
else FTS4). Explicit memory tool plus background extraction (add, update,
delete) on a cheap model. Inject global and thread memory up to ~1,500
tokens each; rest via recall. Rejected: embeddings in v1; JSON in settings. Outcome (S-1, 2026-10-02): passed.
androidx.sqlite:sqlite-bundled 2.5.2 ships SQLite 3.46.0 with FTS5 trigram;
6 JVM tests in spikes/fts5 find Bangla, English and mixed facts by a
three-code-point fragment ("থিস", "dee", "ট্রে"). Limits: MATCH needs 3+
characters (LIKE scans below that); "thesis" does not find "থিসিস". Needs
Room 2.7 (D-023); arm64 native library adds 0.8 MB compressed.

## D-010 · 2026-10-02 · Providers — accepted
One OpenAI-compatible module with presets, one native Gemini module.
Rejected: a module per service (same wire format).

## D-011 · 2026-10-02 · Web search — accepted
Tavily default, then Ollama, then Exa on quota errors; web_fetch with jsoup
and Readability4J, capped. YouTube search = web_search on youtube.com.
Rejected: DuckDuckGo scraping (Kai 9000 hangs), Brave (card required).
Amendment (user, 2026-10-02): queries hold only general topic words, never
names, personal details or file contents (tool guideline); every query is
shown in its step card; web search can be switched off per thread. Why:
Tavily stores queries with no fixed deletion period and may use them to
improve its service (privacy policy of 24 November 2025). Outcome (S-4,
2026-10-02): passed. Tavily answers in 2.2 s with short snippets and finds
YouTube videos with include_domains; Ollama web search works on an account
without credit, returns 3,500 to 8,800 characters per result (cap needed),
and its web_fetch endpoint returns 404. Quota codes from Tavily's docs: 429,
432, 433. Recordings in testdata/search/.

## D-012 · 2026-10-02 · YouTube summaries via Gemini only — accepted
Rejected: NewPipeExtractor (scraping, breaks), yt-dlp and ffmpeg (no Android). Outcome (S-3, 2026-10-02):
passed on gemini-3.8-flash; gemini-2.5-flash is closed to new users (404).
A 19-minute video costs 105,878 input tokens and takes 14 to 21 s; a Bangla
prompt gets a good Bangla summary; MEDIA_RESOLUTION_LOW did not lower the
count; a repeat call reused 102,276 tokens from Gemini's automatic cache.
Errors seen: 503 overload (retry worked), 403 for an unavailable video.
Whether the key is on the free tier is not visible in the response.

## D-013 · 2026-10-02 · Python as on-demand Pyodide — accepted
Downloaded with checksum check; micropip packages; first-run tool picker,
Settings install and remove, just-in-time install card. Rejected: Chaquopy
bundled (+25–40 MB, fixed packages, reaches app secrets).

## D-014 · 2026-10-02 · 16 tools, pi token patterns — accepted
read_file, write_file, edit_file, find_files, search_files, share_file,
web_search, web_fetch, youtube_summarize, run_code, artifact, memory,
delegate, phone, schedule, mcp. One prompt line per tool; schemas only when
active; truncation notices name the next call; skills loaded via read_file;
one mcp proxy tool. Rejected: ~30 single-purpose tools (2x tokens).

## D-015 · 2026-10-02 · Subagents — accepted with amendment
delegate (single or parallel), minimal default tools plus extra_tools, no
parent context, capped answer, no nesting, budgets. request_tool goes to the
permission broker; approval unanswered for 3 minutes: skip that part and
continue, or stop and return results with the skipped parts listed.
ask_parent at most twice; shared notes board. Rejected: tool requests via
the main model (costly), direct agent chat (loops, deadlocks).

## D-016 · 2026-10-02 · Jev routing — superseded by D-022

## D-017 · 2026-10-02 · Files: copy in, work, export — accepted
Share sheet, attach picker, one linked folder → inbox/; export to
Downloads/Jonaki, save as, share, linked folder, with approval.
Rejected: all-files access.

## D-018 · 2026-10-02 · HTML artifacts — accepted
Self-contained HTML in artifacts/, WebView with network and file access off,
versions, PDF via print. Offline report and slide skills with a bundled
chart library. Rejected: generated native UI (Kai 9000; no export).

## D-019 · 2026-10-02 · Distribution: GitHub release APK only — accepted
Release APK only, never debug. Google Play requirements deferred.

## D-020 · 2026-10-02 · Phone tool scope — accepted
v1: calendar, reminder, notify, clipboard, open app. Later: notification
reading. Never: SMS, call log, AccessibilityService control.

## D-021 · 2026-10-02 · Build setup reused from the user's apps — accepted
System Gradle 9.7.1, AGP 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.1.0, KSP 2.1.0-1.0.29, Compose BOM
2024.11.00, Room 2.6.1, Java 17, arm64-v8a, release signing as in
BD-calendar. Why: all already in ~/.gradle (865 MB), no new toolchain
download. Rejected: latest versions (new downloads, untested with Gradle 9.7).

## D-022 · 2026-10-02 · Jev as an optional helper — accepted
deciders/jev behind a Decider interface, one call per user message with
parallel questions: which skill (if any); which memories among full-text
candidates are relevant; does the message hold a durable fact (gates memory
extraction); which web_search results to keep. Settings: Jev on/off plus a
switch each for skills, memory and search filtering; endpoint OpenRouter or
TypeSafe direct. Off or no key: list all skills, inject top memories by pin
and recency, extract on a timer, keep all results. Hints go in the latest
message, never the system prompt. Answers under 0.6 confidence or slower
than 1.5 s are ignored. Why: $0.042 per million input tokens; TypeSafe
reports 2.3x fewer wrong skill loads. Rejected: Jev for model routing and
jev-router as main model (user ruling). Risk: English-first; spike S-5
tests Bangla.

## D-023 · 2026-10-02 · Room 2.7.2 with the bundled SQLite driver — accepted
Use Room 2.7.2 with androidx.sqlite:sqlite-bundled 2.5.2 instead of Room
2.6.1 (changes a D-021 version). Why: S-1 shows the bundled SQLite 3.46.0
has FTS5 trigram for Bangla; Room 2.6.1 can only use Android's own SQLite,
which is 3.18 on Android 8 (trigram needs 3.34) and has no FTS5. Cost: new
downloads, about 1.9 MB of native code in the APK (0.8 MB compressed).
Room 2.7.2 with Kotlin 2.1.0 and KSP 2.1.0-1.0.29 is checked when M1 builds
core/storage. Rejected: Room 2.6.1 with FTS4 (no trigram; Bangla matching
depends on word splitting). Outcome: pending.

## D-024 · 2026-10-02 · Visual design: Firefly look with Rail line steps — accepted
Material 3 structure. Firefly colours and shapes: leaf-dark night theme,
pale paddy-green day theme, one firefly yellow-green for live work only,
rounded shapes, a glowing dot on working threads. Inside a run, Rail line's
step track: one station per tool step (done, running, waiting), with
per-step times. Theme follows the system, with a manual toggle. English UI
only. Mockups: docs/mockups/index.html. Rejected: pure Rail line (too
formal for quick asks), pure Firefly (step list lacks detail).

## D-025 · 2026-10-02 · Logo: the lit j — accepted
A lowercase j whose dot is the firefly, lit with a soft halo, on the
leaf-dark ground; one-colour version for themed icons and notifications.
Options: docs/mockups/logo.html. Rejected: literal firefly (wings vanish at
48 px), step track (not tied to the name), light trail (faint when small).
